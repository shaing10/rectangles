# rectangles

## What can you find here
This repository contains my answers to an algorithmic assigment.
You can find here:
1. code that generates R which is a large rectangle, and smaller non-overlapping, aligned-to-axis rectangles inside it - `gen_valid_data.py`.
2. code that checks if an (R, rectangles) are valid - into `unit_test.py`.
3. Having a valid (R, rectangles), there is a script that fill in R with new rectangles such that all the rectangles - given and new ones - are axis aligned and non overlapping and they cover all R's area - `algo.py`.

## Usage
Run `unit_test.py` file to see it in action - this unit_test plots visual results.
Attached a .docx file with few observations and thoughts about this task.


## Requierments
I used basic packages only, I guess everyone has them in his basic environment. There is a requierments.txt file that can help you creating the desired environment if you want.
